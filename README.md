# Demo Chat App

Deployed with Heroku at https://mysterious-falls-10212.herokuapp.com/

## Tech stack:

* `node.js` as backend
* `mongodb` as db
* `socket.io` as front and back ends communication layer

## Suggestions TODO:
(Things that more or less obvious todo, but I had to ignore this stuff since you aksed me for a simple solution)

* Multi-process socket.io configuration (for scalability)
* Validate/type coercing values of front-end requests at the server-side
* Migrate to ES2015 standards
* Add code quality validations like eslint/jslint/jshint/etc.
